# Getting Started with CAMP COFFEE REACT NATIVE

<h2>Steps to download and start contributing</h2>

1. Clone the project down to your local.  From your terminal, run
   <pre><code> git clone git@github.com:jdavault/camp-coffee-react-native.git 
   </code></pre>

2. Change your directory and run these two commands
   <pre><code> cd camp-coffee-react-native
	yarn install
	expo start
   </code></pre>

3. BEFORE MAKING any CHANGES, do the steps below.  Get your main branch current (git pull), and then create a feature branch)
   <pre><code> git checkout main
	git pull
	git checkout -b feature-some-descriptive-name
   </code></pre>
   <ul>
  		<li>
	   	You can skip he first command if you are already in the main branch
		</li>
		<li>
	   	Give branch descriptive name (https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices)
	  	</li>
	  	<li>
	   	Note, -b creates the branch, but if the branch has already been created  you can leave that off
		</li>
	</ul>
4. Make a few changes and then do a commit 
	<pre><code> git status
	git add .
	git status 
	git commit -m “Some descriptive info about your changes”
   </code></pre>
   <ul>
  		<li>
			Note, you can us add . or add each file separately
	  	</li>
	</ul>
5.  Once you have a few commits and feel like you are ready to collaborate with the team lead and do a PR
	<pre><code> git push –set-upstream origin feature-some-descriptive-name
   	</code></pre>
   	<ul>
  		<li>
			set upstream needed the first time .. you can also use -u instead 
	  	</li>
	</ul>
6.  After your pull requests has been approved and merged you can delete it locally and from github
     <pre><code>  git checkout main
	  git pull 
	  git branch -d feature-some-descriptive-name
	  git push origin --delete feature-some-descriptive-name
	  git branch
   	</code></pre>
   	<ul>
  		<li>
	Usually the PR approver will delete the remote branch after approving the PR
	  	</li>
	</ul>
